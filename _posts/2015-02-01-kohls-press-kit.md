Over the years we have teamed up with the creative team at [Becker Design](http://beckerdesign.net) to create the Kohl's Electronic Press Kit. We were responsible for programming all php, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS used on the site. We leveraged the jQuery framework and the latest HTML5 and CSS3 functionality to provide a great experience for Kohlâ€™s customers.
