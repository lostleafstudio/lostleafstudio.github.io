##### Description:
Your mission is to score as many points possible by destroying enemy tankers, helicopters, fuel depots, jets and bridges before your jet crashes or runs out of fuel.

To learn to fly successful missions, you'll need the sensitivity, touch and sharpshooting skills of a precision jet pilot.  But that takes time and practice.

Good Luck!
