Take to the skies in **River Raiders**, a modern tribute to one of the most iconic top-down shooters of the classic console era. Navigate the River of No Return, strike enemy forces, manage your fuel, and push your skills to survive farther than ever.

Your mission is simple: fly fast, shoot straight, and stay alive. Enemy tankers, helicopters, jets, fuel depots, and fortified bridges crowd every stretch of the river. Precision flying and sharp reaction time are the difference between a clean run and a fiery crash.

Every section of the river is a new challenge. Tight channels, shifting terrain, scarce fuel, and increasingly aggressive enemies make each run unpredictable. As you improve, the river tests you harder. Only the best pilots make it deep into enemy territory.

### Features

- Premium experience: fully unlocked, no ads, no in-app purchases
- Endless arcade action with handcrafted maps inspired by the original era
- Classic top-down jet combat rebuilt for modern touchscreen play
- Responsive controls designed for quick dodges and accurate firing
- Fuel management adds strategy to every run—slow to refuel, blast forward to survive
- Progressive difficulty as the river narrows and resources thin out
- Universal build for phone and tablet
- Offline play, no internet required

### Gameplay Overview

Master the fundamentals of arcade flight. Bank left and right through twisting river paths. Time your shots to take down enemy aircraft and destroy bridges for high-value points. Fuel drains constantly; when your gauge runs low, finding a depot becomes a race against time.

As you advance deeper, depots become rare and enemy formations tighten. Smart flying—dodging as much as destroying—becomes essential. Study the river, learn its patterns, and refine your route for maximum survival.

#### How far down the river can you make it?
