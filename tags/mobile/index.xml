Relive your childhood adventures on the river of no return. Available now for iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your mission is to score as many points possible by destroying enemy tankers, helicopters, fuel depots, jets and bridges before your jet crashes or runs out of fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn to fly successful missions, you&amp;rsquo;ll need the sensitivity, touch and sharpshooting skills of a precision jet pilot. But that takes time and practice.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
