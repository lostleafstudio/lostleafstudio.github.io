Relive your childhood adventures on the river of no return. Available now for iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your mission is to score as many points possible by destroying enemy tankers, helicopters, fuel depots, jets and bridges before your jet crashes or runs out of fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn to fly successful missions, you&amp;rsquo;ll need the sensitivity, touch and sharpshooting skills of a precision jet pilot. But that takes time and practice.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>River Raiders</title><link>https://lostleafstudio.com/apps/river-raiders/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lostleafstudio.com/apps/river-raiders/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Take to the skies in River Raiders, a modern tribute to one of the most iconic top-down shooters of the classic console era. Navigate the River of No Return, strike enemy forces, manage your fuel, and push your skills to survive farther than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your mission is simple: fly fast, shoot straight, and stay alive. Enemy tankers, helicopters, jets, fuel depots, and fortified bridges crowd every stretch of the river. Precision flying and sharp reaction time are the difference between a clean run and a fiery crash.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
